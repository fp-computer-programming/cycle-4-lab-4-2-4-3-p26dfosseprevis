Create a Python file named lab_4-2.py
Create a variable called school and set it equal to "Fairfield Prep".
Write a statement that splits "Fairfield" and stores it as first_half, and a similar statement that splits " Prep" and stores it as second_half.
Print each half on its own line, then print the two halves joined together using concatenation.
